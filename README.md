# Instacart Basket Analysis

## Project Summary
This project analyzed Instacart’s grocery order data to derive insights into customer behaviors and product trends. The goal is to help the marketing and sales teams implement more targeted campaigns by segmenting customers based on their shopping habits and demographics.

Using Python and libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`, the data was cleaned, merged, analyzed, and visualized through a structured, industry-standard pipeline.

## Key Questions 
- What are the busiest days and times for grocery orders?  
- Are there certain times of day when customers spend more money?  
- Which departments and product types are most frequently ordered?  
- What is the distribution among users as to how often they return to Instacart? 
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
- What differences in ordering habits are found of different customer profiles?
